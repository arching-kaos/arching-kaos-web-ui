Web UI for arching-kaos
-----------------------

This repository hosts the html, css and js files for presenting "arching-kaos"
to visitors.

## Visit the demo pages
For demo, you can visit https://arching-kaos.net .

### All demo links (may vary on running versions)
- [Net](https://arching-kaos.net),
- [Com](https://arching-kaos.com),
- [News](https://news.arching-kaos.net)
- [Dev](https://dev.arching-kaos.net)

## Usage
1) You will need to clone the repository,
2) host the files on a HTTP server,
3) make a SSL certificate (is needed for Stellar connectivity) for your server,
4) edit `js/arching-kaos-web-ui-settings.js` to match your desired links.

## Development workflow proposal (how I 've done it so far)
Instead of serving the files statically on a server, I use IPFS and fetch them
from a public IPFS gateway that I've set up for the project.

The workflow would be like:

```
git clone https://github.com/arching-kaos/arching-kaos-web-ui
cd arching-kaos-web-ui
xdg-open http://127.0.0.1:8080/$(ipfs add -Q -r src)
```

Then you can edit as far as you want and see your changes by issuing the
following command.
```
xdg-open http://127.0.0.1:8080/$(ipfs add -Q -r src)
```

Of course, `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` should be replaced in both cases with your
remote IPFS gateway.

## Notes

If you are trying to view the same results as in the demo pages but from a
public IPFS gateway, you may fail. Your IPFS nodes need to be in the same swarm
as the one Arching Kaos is operating at. For that, you will need to install
[arching-kaos-tools](https://github.com/arching-kaos/arching-kaos-tools). You
can also remove or change swarm to start your own network.
